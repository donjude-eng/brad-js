    <h1>You already know about variables, types, expressions...
        we could go on. The point is, you already know a few things about
        JavaScript. In fact, you know enough to write some real code. Some code that
        does something interesting, some code that someone would want to use. What
        you’re lacking is the real experience of writing code, and we’re going to remedy
        that right here and now. How? By jumping in head first and coding up a casual
        game, all written in JavaScript. Our goal is ambitious but we’re going to take it one
        step at a time. Come on, let’s get this started, and if you want to launch the next
        casual startup, we won’t stand in your way; the code is yours.</h1>
