    <h1>JavaScript gives you superpowers. The true programming
        language of the web, JavaScript lets you add behavior to your web pages. No
        more dry, boring, static pages that just sit there looking at you—with JavaScript
        you’re going to be able to reach out and touch your users, reac t to interesting
        events, grab data from the web to use in your pages, draw graph ics right in your
        web pages and a lot more. And once you know JavaScript you’ll also be in a
        position to create totally new behaviors for your users.</h1>
