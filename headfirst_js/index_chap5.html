    <h2>So far you’ve been using primitives and arrays in your
        code. And, you’ve approached coding in quite a procedural manner using
        simple statements, conditionals and for/while loops with functions—that’s not
        exactly object-oriented. In fact, it’s not object-oriented at all! We did use a few
        objects here and there without really knowing it, but you haven’t written any of
        your own objects yet. Well, the time has come to leave this boring procedural town
        behind to create some objects of your own. In this chapter, you’re going to find
        out why using objects is going to make your life so much better—well, better in a
        programming sense (we can’t really help you with your fashion sense and your
        JavaScript skills all in one book). Just a warning: once you’ve discovered objects
        you’ll never want to come back. Send us a postcard when you get there.</h2>
